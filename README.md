# Web Scraping – 20-Minute College Presentation Content

## 1. Introduction
In today’s data-driven world, organizations rely heavily on information collected from the internet. Websites contain massive amounts of valuable data such as product prices, news articles, job listings, sports statistics, and research information. Manually collecting this data is time-consuming, repetitive, and prone to human error.  
Web scraping provides an automated solution that allows computers to collect, process, and store data efficiently and at scale.

## 2. What Is Web Scraping?
Web scraping is the automated process of extracting useful and meaningful information from websites using software programs or scripts. Instead of manually copying data, a scraper program reads the website’s HTML structure and extracts the required elements.  
The extracted data is usually converted into structured formats such as CSV files, Excel sheets, JSON, or databases for further analysis and use.

## 3. How Web Scraping Works
The web scraping process generally follows a step-by-step workflow:

1. A request is sent to the target website.
2. The server responds with the webpage content (HTML).
3. The scraper parses the HTML using selectors or tags.
4. Required data elements are identified and extracted.
5. The extracted data is cleaned and stored for later use.

This process can be repeated automatically for multiple pages or at regular intervals.

## 4. Tools and Technologies Used
Several tools and libraries are commonly used for web scraping:

- **Requests** – Sends HTTP requests and retrieves webpage content.
- **BeautifulSoup** – Parses HTML and XML documents to extract data easily.
- **Selenium** – Automates browsers and handles JavaScript-heavy or dynamic websites.
- **Scrapy** – A powerful framework for large-scale and high-performance scraping projects.
- **APIs** – When available, APIs provide a cleaner and legal way to access structured data.

Each tool is chosen based on the complexity and nature of the website.

## 5. Real-World Applications
Web scraping is widely used across many industries:

- Price monitoring and comparison
- Market and competitor research
- Job listing aggregation platforms
- News and content aggregation
- Sports scores and statistics collection
- Social media trend analysis
- Data collection for machine learning and analytics

These applications help organizations make data-driven decisions quickly and accurately.

## 6. Code Example / Demonstration
A simple Python script using Requests and BeautifulSoup can demonstrate the concept of web scraping. Even a basic example that extracts titles or table data from a webpage is sufficient to explain the working process during a presentation.  
Screenshots of input pages and extracted output can also be used if live demonstrations are not allowed.

## 7. Ethical and Legal Considerations
Ethical web scraping is extremely important. Responsible scraping involves:

- Respecting website terms and conditions
- Following robots.txt rules
- Limiting request rates to avoid server overload
- Avoiding the collection of personal or sensitive data

Following ethical guidelines ensures that web scraping is used responsibly and legally.

## 8. Limitations and Challenges
Despite its usefulness, web scraping has several challenges:

- Websites frequently change their structure
- CAPTCHA and anti-bot protections
- IP blocking and rate limiting
- Legal restrictions in certain cases

Scrapers often require regular maintenance to handle these challenges.

## 9. Future of Web Scraping
The future of web scraping is closely linked with artificial intelligence and machine learning. Advanced techniques such as AI-based pattern recognition, automatic data extraction, and intelligent data pipelines are improving accuracy and scalability.  
Web scraping will continue to play a critical role in data collection for AI-driven systems and analytics platforms.
